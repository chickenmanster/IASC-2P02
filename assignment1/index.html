        <h2>1. Flatness: The Lemon of Life</h2>

        <p> In the beginning of time, the cave dwellers could only see the shadow of a Lemon on the wall. 
            It was one long oval and two more ovals sticking out from either side of it. 
            It was ominous and floated in the air on the cave wall, and the cave dwellers were intrigued by this odd shape. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But then, all of a sudden, <span class="clickable" id="first-change">the Lemon began to open up,</span> 
            and it looked like Two circles expanding and shrinking while a square, which was in the middle of the mystical 
            object this whole time, spun in different directions when the circles consumed it. From the cave perspective, 
            two hollow spheres expand and contract in the horizontal plane. 
        </p>

        <p> Suddenly, <span class="clickable" id="second-change">the Lemon began to move and disappear</span> 
            on the cave wall until the cave became very dark. The people of the cave did not like this 
            Lemon anymore because it made their cave dark and cold. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The cave people think the Lemon of life rules their world, which projects itself on the cave wall. 
            They believed a new seed was born each time the Lemon opened because it changed directions. 
            The square inside of this Lemon is the seed of life. Because when life gives you a Lemon, you make lemonade, 
            the cave dwellers decide that this must be the Lemon of life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The concept of flatness stems from naivety. 
            It is the inability to comprehend multiple options outside of what someone already knows. 
            Flatness is like the black-and-white cognitive bias. The bias is that someone thinks there are only 
            two solutions to a problem without thinking about whether there can be more options in between. 
            In the cave, the people inside do not see any option other than the word lemon/pencil expanding. 
            They would never consider or understand a torus and plane being what is there because of the people's 
            lack of outside references and knowledge to base their ideas and opinions on. Their perceptions of the 
            world rely heavily on the literal one side of the equation and not the entire answer. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The people of the cave only know about this Lemon orb and see a square. 
            A lemon is considered a three-dimensional shape but not the outline of one. 
            After changing into two overlapping spheres with a square inside, the Lemon became 
            an object of interest for the cave people because of its unfamiliarity. 
            They do not consider that it is a three-dimensional object that is spinning with a square inside it.

        <h2>2. Seeing Double: The Real Evil</h2>

        <p>Once the flatlanders finally escaped the cave, 
            they joined the civilization with the answers and a different view on life: 
            the people of <span class="clickable" id="third-change">a double world.</span> 
            The cave wall was just one part of a larger story for these individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
            They could see a three-dimensional torus spinning around with a plane inside it. 
            The torus is why the lemon shadow appeared to be opening and closing from the cave's perspective. 
            The plane flips and spins in different directions on the shadow. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The people outside the cave see that the object casting the lemon-shaped shadow is the eye of Sauron from the Lord of the Rings. 
            The eye is spinning because it is searching for the one who stole the ring of power. 
            As the eye begins looking for the ring, <span class="clickable" id="fourth-change">Frodo destroys the ring in Mount Doom,</span> which illuminates the eye onto the cave wall. 
            The volcano's light goes out as the eye slowly dies out. All heat and light from the surrounding area disappear, making the cave 
            dwellers' lives cold and miserable, but the people outside are happy since Sauron is gone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Seeing double is a way to describe objects in the second and third dimensions. 
            Without the shadow and the object (2D), someone could not piece together both sides of the story. 
            When we close one eye and open the other, we see one angle of the world. 
            Looking through the sliver of a curtain with one eye is an example. 
            The view from past the curtain changes completely from eye to eye. 
            That is the concept of seeing double: a world shift from having access to multiple lenses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Seeing double is apparent in politics. People outside the cave have different views than those inside the cave. 
            They see that the eye of the Sauron is a multidimensional object that looks completely different from the lemon 
            and that there is more than one possible truth to the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two-dimensional view is restricted because they are only able to see essentially half of the truth, 
            while the view outside of the cave in 3D is more telling of what is going on. The view from the outside 
            reveals more of the truth about how the people inside the cave see the world.  
        </p>
        <p>
            They both see the flat shadow cast on the wall, but the 3ders notice how that shadow is only an effect, not the object itself. 
            Shadows form with the combination of light and a multidimensional object. 
            A hard truth only understood from seeing double is that objects cannot be two-dimensional because they are only effects created by three-dimensional objects. 
            Therefore, the round world is superior because of the extended context given by multiple dimensions and angles.
