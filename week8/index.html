        <h1>Interactive Essay</h1>
        <p>My interactive essay was about a scary lemon that turned out to be the eye of sauron from the Lord Of The Rings. This project was funny for me because the concepts were a bit hard to grasp, but I think it was a good learning experience for my journey into the theoretical world.</p>
