        <h1>The Visualization of Oz</h1>
        <h2>Garrett Wager</h2>
        
        <p>"The Wizard of Oz" by L. Frank Baum is a magical tale of friendship and determination. The story follows the main character, Dorothy, a young girl from Kansas, on her quest to return home after being mysteriously transported to the wonderful land of Oz. She arrives in Oz and is greeted by the munchkins who inform her of the Wizard of Oz and the Wicked Witch of the West. Dorothy is accompanied by her adorable dog, Toto, and picks up a scarecrow, tin man, and cowardly lion who all have dreams and wishes as well. The scarecrow wants a brain, the tin man wants a heart, and the lion desires courage.

            They learn their wishes can be granted to them by the Wizard of Oz, and after discovering each other's needs, band together and embark on a quest to visit Emerald City. When they arrive at the Emerald City, Dorothy is sent on another mission because the Wicked Witch of the West steals Toto, but she ends up taking down the Witch by burning her. In the end, each of the characters gets their wishes from the Wizard, and Dorothy returns to Kansas as if nothing ever happened.

            <p>I chose to do my visualization on "The Wizard of Oz" because it is a very vibrant and fun novel. Each character and plot point feels unique to one another. I also have lots of childhood memories with this story so it was something I am familiar with and enjoy.

        <p> Through this section, I discovered that these side characters appear at distinct points in the story. The Munchkins appear in the beginning, the Wizard of Oz appears in the middle and end, while the flying monkeys come in at two points toward the end of the story. The monkeys only appear when the wizard comes back at the end of the story. </p>
        <p> It is interesting to think about how the munchkins are mostly present near the beginning because they are the quest bearers for our story. Without the munchkins coming into play and giving Dorothy a warm welcome to the land of Oz, our story may not have gone the same way as it ended up going. The Wizard of Oz and Flying Monkeys are mentioned a few times while in the Munchkin country because they will be important to the climax of the conquest to escape the land of Oz. The monkeys represent the foreshadowing of the Wicked Witch of the West because they are her army and the Wizard is also foreshadowing the mysterious ruler of this strange land in which Dorothy finds herself.
        </p> 
        <p>
            At the top of the visualization, I noticed that the majority of Monkey and Wizard appearances happen distinctly from one another and do not entirely overlap. The monkeys never interact with the Wizard because they never enter his castle. This could indicate that they are not truly evil as discovered in the story, or the wizard cast a spell to keep them out. I think they both represented good and evil from a side character perspective, so the two do not typically mix well. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I made the terms appear as wizard caps, otherwise known as cones, to allude to the Wizard of Oz being mentioned throughout and his influence on the story. It is also a nod to the Wicked Witch of the West’s hat because she impacts each of these characters against their will in the story. The colors were chosen to represent each character: the brown of a monkey, Oz’s Emerald City, and the Munchkins' favorite blue attire. I also kept these terms relatively spaced out but still in a box formation because these characters are all confined to the world of Oz.

        <p>The three sidekicks to Dorothy are the timid Lion, the brainless Scarecrow, and the heartless Tin Man. As illustrated in the visualization, these guys come into the story bearing their disabilities one by one until all of them join and try to find a purpose on their quest with Dorothy to find the Wizard and get their wishes granted. Their disabilities are brought up when the characters are introduced, around the time they all meet and embark on their journey, and at the end when they meet the Wizard of Oz and make their pleas to have their disabilities changed and wishes granted.
        </p>
        <p>
            I played with space and positioning to make the visualization resemble the cyclone that took Dorothy to Oz. Including this visual effect animation makes all of the main four characters in this story represented in the visualization. The maroon is for the brain that the Scarecrow is lacking, the silver matches the color of the Tin Man, and the orange is for the Lion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The shapes of the meshes are coin-shaped. I was inspired by another story, Aladdin, when choosing this shape for the data visualization. The Wizard of Oz grants wishes in a similar way to the genie from Aladdin, which is why I chose a coin shape. The coins represent the wishes in physical form.    
        </p>
        <p>
            I originally wanted to make the word “heart” appear as a 3D heart but ended up choosing an object that could encompass the theme of wishes for all the characters. For my future visualizations, I would like to implement more unique animation loops and different layouts for the data to spread across. I think the blocks floating around in a significant formation and then moving into a different one together would be pretty fun to accomplish in the future.
